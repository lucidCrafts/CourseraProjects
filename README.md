It is a visualization of Page ranks for "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada".

You can download and open the force.html to see the visualization using the d3 and i preset it with 50 nodes, each node representing different links from the main page, I did around eleven iteration using the page rank algorithm on the sql database to rank the page more accuractly. 
However, the database that is created using the spidering code is not uploaded here, since i found out that there is a 25mb limit on the file that can be added here. Iam open to more ideas or anybody who is willing to work with me on anything regarding Data Science stuffs. 


WIKI canada.ipynb have all the code that i have used for this visualization, i put it all in one notebook file since it is more intutitive rather than having the codes in seperates files. You can download and install SQL lite3 to open the database file that will be created, if you really want to see the database created or spidered from the page that we will be choosing. but on default it is set to the above link if you simply go ahead and hit enter.
