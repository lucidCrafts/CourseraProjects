It is a visualization of Page ranks for "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada".

You can download and open the force.html to see the visualization using the d3. each node representing different links from the main page, I did a few iterations using the page rank algorithm on the SQL database to rank the page more accurately. 
However, the database created using the spidering code is not uploaded here, I am open to more ideas or anybody who is willing to work with me on anything regarding Data Science kinds of stuff. 


WIKI canada.ipynb have all the code that I have used for this visualization You can download and install SQL lite3 to open the database file that will be created if you really want to see the database created or spidered from the page that we will be choosing. but on default it is set to the above link if you simply go ahead and hit enter.
